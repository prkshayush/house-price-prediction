# House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning models. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training.

## Requirements

To install the required packages, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

or use

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section includes various analyses and visualizations to understand the data better. It uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## Modelling

The modeling section includes training and evaluating different machine learning models such as:

    Linear Regression,
    Random Forest Regressor,
    Decision Tree Regressor,
    Gradient Boosting Regressor,
    XGBoost Regressor,
    LightGBM Regressor
